Cats of Jasnah, a web based game for learning categories and logic

I made this game for my 3 year old to develop logical language skills. It progresses from counting up to increasingly difficult word problems using boolean logic. This seems like a more intutive path for her to learn at her current level of development and I couldn't find something like this elsewhere.

Enjoy!
