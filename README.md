Cats of Jasnah, a web based game for learning categories and logic

I made this game with my 3 year old to develop logical language skills. It progresses from counting up to increasingly difficult word problems using boolean logic. This seems like an effective path for her to learn at her current level of development and I couldn't find something like this elsewhere.

Enjoy!
